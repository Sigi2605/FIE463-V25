2. Select HTTPS or SSH depending on your authentication method (HTTPS for Windows, SSH for Mac) and copy the URL.
3. You can clone the repository directly in Visual Studio Code, or use the command line:

    _Windows:_
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/richardfoltyn/FIE463-V25.git
    ```
    _Mac (using SSH keys):_
    ```bash
    git clone git@github.com:richardfoltyn/FIE463-V25.git
    ```


## Creating a Conda environment

Using the Anaconda Prompt (Windows) or Terminal (Mac), you can use 
the environment definition file ([environment.yml](environment.yml)) provided in this repository to create 
a conda environment called `FIE463`:
```bash
conda env create -f environment.yml
```
